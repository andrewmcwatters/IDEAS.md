## A new programming language
A safe low-level programming language inspired by C

*Notes:* I want safety and scripting. Should I just use [TCC][1]?

## libcspred
A [client-side prediction][2] library in C

## OpenPhotoshop
_(or maybe "OpenShop," which may avoid copyright infringement)_

A free and open-source, clean-room reverse engineered alternative to Photoshop,
with only a subset of functionality based on the needs of the contributors
working on it. As of 2022, Sketch is the de-facto alternative for ["user
interface and user experience design of websites and mobile apps"][3], but is
only available on macOS.

Many workflows today still require Adobe Photoshop and it is only available as a
subscription now.
