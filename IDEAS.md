## OpenPhotoshop
_(or maybe "OpenShop," which may avoid copyright infringement)_

A free and open-source, clean-room reverse engineered alternative to Photoshop,
with only a subset of functionality based on the needs of the contributors
working on it. As of 2022, Sketch is the de-facto alternative for ["user
interface and user experience design of websites and mobile apps"][3], but is
only available on macOS.

Many workflows today still require Adobe Photoshop and it is only available as a
subscription now.

## www-strict
A collection of patches to existing World Wide Web standards that make
previously-undefined behavior normative such as [The CSS 2.1 processing
model][4].
